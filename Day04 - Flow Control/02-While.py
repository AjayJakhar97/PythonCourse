# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

#%% Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

#%% Write a program to print even numbers up to and including 10 and skip even numbers
# variable should between 0 and 20

i = 0
while i < 20:
  i += 1
  if i%2 == 0:
    print(i)
  elif i > 10:
    break
  else:
    continue



#%% Below code will keep running infinitely. So press "Ctrl + c" to stop it
i = 1
while i == 1:
    print(i, "- Hello again...")
    i = i+1  # 1 + 1
    print("The current value of i is ", i)

# The break Statement
# ========================
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
#%% Exit the loop when i is 3:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

# The continue Statement
# =========================
# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
#%% Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# The else Statement
# ============================
# With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

#%% Print a message once the condition is false:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")


#%% print 1,2,3

x = 3
y = 0

while y < x:
    print(y+1)
    y = y + 1

#%% Make sure you know how to find modulus for next exercise 

print(3%1)
print(3%2)
