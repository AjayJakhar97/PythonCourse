'''
The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.

class range(stop)
class range(start, stop[, step])

++ The arguments to the range constructor must be integers. 
++ If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. 
++ If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0. 
++ If step is zero, ValueError is raised.
++ The contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i

# 1- containment tests
#%% Does below number exist in the range?
print(11 in s)
print(11 not in s)
#%% Let's test when something is present in the range
print(10 in s)

#%% 4- support for negative indices

#%% 5- length of s
len(s)

#%% smallest item of s
min(s)
#%% largest item of s
max(s)

#%% index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j)
# s.index(x[, i[, j]])
# s.index(6,0,9) # This fails so try s[i:j].index(x)
s[0:9].index(6)

#%% index raises ValueError when x is not found in s
print(s.index(11))

#%% total number of occurrences of x in s
s.count(6)

# Testing range objects for equality with == and != compares them as sequences. 
# That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. 

# %% Example 1
print(list(range(0, 3, 2)))
print(list(range(0, 4, 2)))
range(0, 3, 2) == range(0, 4, 2)

# %% Example 2
range(0) == range(2, 1, 3)

# %% Example 3
range(0) != range(2, 1, 3)

#%% Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity)
var1 = range(2, 1, 3)
var2 = range(0)
print(id(var1))
print(id(var2))
var1 == var2

# The + (concatenation) and * (repetition) operations are not support by range sequence  (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern).
#%% Let's check by creating below ranges
myVar1 = range(10)
myVar2 = range(5)
print(list(myVar1))
print(list(myVar2))
# %% + (concatenation)
var1 + var2
# %% * (repetition)
myVar1 * myVar2
# %%
print(list(myVar1[3:5]))

'''
The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).

# %% Exercise - 
'''
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and...

1- for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and 
2- for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” and
3- for multiples of '3' and '5' print 'FizzBuzz'

For example: Given a number , for each integer in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

# Loop for 100 times i.e. range
for item in range(1,101):
