# %% Most Values are True

# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
# Any string is True, except empty strings.
# Any number is True, except 0.
# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

# %% You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:


def myFunction():
    return True


if myFunction():
    print("YES!")
else:
    print("NO!")


# %% Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
x = 200
y = "Hello"
print(isinstance(x, int))
print(isinstance(y, int))

# %% One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:


class MyClass:
    def __len__(self):
        # def something(self):
        return 0


MyObj1 = MyClass()
# print(MyObj1)
print(bool(MyObj1))


# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:


# %% any()
