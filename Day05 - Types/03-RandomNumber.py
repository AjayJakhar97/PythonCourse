# Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
# Reference : https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

#%% display a random number between 1 and 9
import random
print(random.randrange(1, 3))

# %%
print(random.randrange(1, 2))

# %%
print(random.randrange(1, 3))

# %% random always starts with 0 unless specified otherwise
print(random.randrange(10))


#%% Exercise 01 - (if and random)

'''
You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalized and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.
'''

# Remember to use the random module ğŸ‘‡
import random

# Get the two random numbers
randomSide = random.randrange(0, 2)
# randomSide = random.randint(0, 1)

# write the logic using those random numbers
if randomSide == 1:
    print("Heads")
else:
    print("Tails")

#%%
print (5)


# %% Task - You need to guess if number is correct or not
# You have 3 chances
# Output should be 
    #  "That's the correct number" if guessed correctly or...
    # 'Sorry! You exhausted 3 chances. The number was xx'

def GuessTheNumber(myNumber):
    pass

GuessTheNumber()

#%% Solution

import random

def GuessTheNumber():
    chances = 3
    luckyNumber = random.randint(1,1)
    while(chances > 0):
        myNumber = int(input("Enter a number from 1 to 10: "))
        if myNumber == luckyNumber:
            return f"{luckyNumber} is the correct number"
        else:
            chances -= 1
            if chances == 0:
                return f"Sorry! You exhausted 3 chances. The number was {luckyNumber}"
            else:
                print("Try again")

GuessTheNumber()
